## Intro

This is my Telegram calendar bot project for Google Calendar.

## Motivation

I do not really like the UX of Apple calendar apps as well as one of the Google Calendar web version.

The bot can create simple events and analyzes your schedule.

## Roadmap

- [x] Dockerfile

- [x] Prune API

- [x] Refactor code, make it readable

- [ ] Add more options to parser

- [ ] Add /freebusy logic

- [ ] Add custom plugins for time management

- [ ] Write docs for people to reuse it
